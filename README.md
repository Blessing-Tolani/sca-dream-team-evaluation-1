# Solution

Item = Bag
I created objects for each item and its property.
I put the objects in a catalogue array.

I used a For loop that iterates 10 times to render each item and its property to the HTML DOM
A button was included in each Item.
When the button is clicked, A function is called that sets the Item Availability.
Click once after page is loaded means Item is not available
Click again means Item is available
